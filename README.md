This is my first app created for internship/job.

Here are some sudgestions you might like to look at while reviewing my project.

Pro's and Con's :

I am pretty much sure that I have very decent and sophisticated validation mechanism used in Personal information page. please have a closer look at

** name validation ( it is longer than 2 characters and ALSO can't containt any numbers)
** email validation (very good slicing methond + @redberry.ge)
\*\*phone number validation (not only phone is 9 digits long only , but it also has to start with 5 (as we are in georgia), but also it cannot containt any letters )

THE MAIN VALIDATION is validation of each input : please pay attention that I have used INVALID circle to mention that particular iput is invalid. I just forgot to make background color red when invalid, and instead made a hard work and did the following one. So it only says input is valid or not upon submission of form . It is very cool for begginer, please check. I will be honoured.

my falls :

THere are couple of disadvantages CSS wise : for example when you type in any input and then want to delete typed information - there is little background which is not in the color of the whole parent element.

second page validation (chess experience) is not that sophisticated as personal one.

THE MAIN DISADVATAGE : on the CHess Experience page you might see that there is 1 validation for 2 inputs (level and character) This input is shared because I really had no time to change it because I needed to deal with Local Storage Things.

THanks in advance <3
